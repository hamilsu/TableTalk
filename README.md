## 1.	Introduction: 
## 2.	Storyboard (screen mockups): Invision, FluidUI, Powerpoint, paint, etc... will be fine. - Storm
## 3.	Functional Requirements in the format (fill in the square brackets with your own words):  - Luke

o	As a [User]

o	I want [Feature]

o	So that I can [Do something]

o	Elaborate each of these with several examples in this format: 

  Given [Prerequisite]
  
  When [Series of Steps]
  
  Then [Expected Result]
  
o	Notes: 
   You should have a few (2-4) requirements.
   
   The Given/When/Then syntax will form the basis of our unit tests. Consider different cases: good data, bad data, multiple sets of data, etc.
   
## 4.	Class Diagram – Mamadou

o	UML-based class diagram.

o	Class Diagram Description: One or two lines for each class to describe use of interfaces,  classes and resources, interfaces, etc. Don't worry about putting 
more than a few words to each class; this does not need to be thorough.

## 5.	JSON Schema – Mamadou

o	 Your project should have an REST endpoint that emits JSON, which another group can consume.  The design document should contain a draft JSON schema for this endpoint. 

  You can create a schema from a Java class at QuickType.io.  This Java class is typically a DTO.  That's all you need at this point.
  
## 6.	Scrum Roles, and who will fill those roles

Luke is UI Specialist

Storm And Mamadou Business Logic

Anne Scum Master

## 7.	github.com project link - Anne
## 8.	 A scrum or kanban board, using GitHub projects or something similar, that contains: - Anne

	A milestone for Milestone #1, with tasks associated.
	
	Projects for Milestone #1.
	
	Tasked stores for Projects for Milestone #1. 
	
	Sprint tasks that elaborate on the stories, with technical details.
	
	These should be technical tasks that are required to implement one of the features.
	
	You only need to task out stories for Sprint #1.  You can task out stories for Sprint #2 and #3 as we get closer to those sprints. 
	
	The Product Owner/Scrum Master/DevOps person on your team should select stories to play for each sprint, from the list of available stories in the Product Backlog.
	
	As long as you have the tasks in GitHub Projects, under Projects, and associated with milestones, you do not need to repeat them in the design doc.  I'll look at  the Project and Milestone view to see them. 
	
	Milestones for Milestone #2 and #3.   
	
	You do not need projects or tasks for these later milestones. You can define those in planning meetings, as we get closer.
